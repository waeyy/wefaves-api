# Note: We still want to validate the email
# See FOSUserBundle/Resources/config/validation/orm.xml to understand
# the UniqueEntity constraint that was originally applied to both
# username and email fields
#
# As you can see, we are only applying the UniqueEntity constraint to
# the email field and not the username field.
